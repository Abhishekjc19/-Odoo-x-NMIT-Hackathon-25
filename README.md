## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, production-ready tech stack:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components**: [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Generative AI**: [Google's Gemini via Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
- **Database**: Designed for use with **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, or **PostgreSQL**. (See Data Persistence section)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) / [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting)

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Persistence

For rapid prototyping, this application currently uses a **mock data strategy**. This is a temporary setup for development and demonstration.

-   **Product & User Data**: Stored in in-memory arrays (`src/lib/data.ts`) and browser `localStorage` (`src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`). This data resets when the server restarts or on different browsers.
-   **Production Database**: The application is designed to be connected to a production database like **MongoDB (Atlas)**, **MySQL**, or **PostgreSQL**. To move to production, the functions in `src/lib/data.ts` and `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx` would need to be updated to interact with the chosen database.

This setup is ideal for demonstrating frontend features, but must be replaced with a proper database solution for a production application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later) and npm installed on your machine.

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add any necessary API keys (e.g., for Google AI and your database connection string).
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the application.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting).
