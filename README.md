- **Fully Responsive**: A beautiful and functional UI that works on all devices, from mobile to desktop.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, production-ready tech stack:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components**: [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Generative AI**: [Google's Gemini via Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
- **Database**: Mock data (in-memory) & Browser `localStorage`
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) / [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting)

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Persistence

For rapid prototyping, this application uses a mock data strategy instead of a traditional database.

-   **Product Information**: All products are stored in an in-memory array located in `src/lib/data.ts`. This data resets every time the server restarts.
-   **User Authentication**: User accounts and sessions are simulated using the browser's `localStorage`. This allows for a persistent logged-in state on a per-user basis without a backend database.

This setup is ideal for development and demonstrating frontend features, but would need to be replaced with a proper database solution (like Firebase Firestore, Supabase, or a traditional SQL/NoSQL database) for a production application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add any necessary API keys (e.g., for Google AI).
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the application.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
